##  Making ribosomes to translate cancer

I delivered a talk at BCI Thursday seminar series on our work on regulation of ribosome biogenesis by subcellular RNA localization.

In this work published in [bioarxiv]() I demonstrated how a RBP called LARP6  regulates  ribosome biogenesis in migrating cells. You could watch the full talk (QMUL access only) [here](https://bcinet.qmcr.qmul.ac.uk/thursday-seminar-series-webinar-archive/)
