## LPDG on proteogenomics

What a fantastic talk by Janne Lehtio! He gave an overview of the lattest research and resources available from his lab, including [DEqMS](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEqMS.html) to perform differential protein expression from qproteomics data, improved version of the limma approach, as well as the familiar papers on [proteome subcellular localization](https://www.subcellbarcode.org/) and [breast cancer proteome landscape](breastcancerlandscape.org) beautifully summarised using shiny apps.
