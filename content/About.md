title: About me
---

My name is Maria Dermit and I am a postdoctoral research assistant at Barts Cancer Institute where I work on big data to understand the importance of post-translational regulation on cancer growth. 

I studied biochemistry, finishing my PhD in 2017. During my academic research I have worked mainly with proteomics and transcriptomics and analysing published data. 
You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/25848)


The aim of this blog is to write about new tricks I learn about the tidyverse. I have been a base R user, and in November 2019 I migrated to the tidyverse, and it is so adictive! I mainly follow Rstudio stars including [Dave Robinson](http://varianceexplained.org/) (I learnt so many useful tricks) [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/). You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dermitmaria) and [GitHub](https://github.com/demar01). 

I live in London, and I have a long-distance relationship with my husband living in Brazil :brazil:
