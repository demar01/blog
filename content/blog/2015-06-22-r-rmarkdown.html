<h1>How I set up this website</h1>
<p>The purpose of this post is to show the simple steps how I created this website using Github, Hugo, Rblogdown and Netfily.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>First I create a new repo on my GitHub</p></li>
<li><p>Then I downloaded <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>, a static site generator and got familiar with the way the information is distributed across folders. I also realise how important choosing the right theme for your purpose is. In my case I wanted something simple, although I found the “hugo-academic” being very popular in academia and gives you load of flexibility. I found <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">this</a> and <a href="http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~pichler/blog/post/set-this-up/setting-up-this-site/">this</a> links particularly useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Download Rblogdown package and I genually get to know a bit about about <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">link</a> great project by Yihui Xi.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a href="https://app.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> to deploy the content of the web into the public domain. I followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syWAKaj-4ck">this</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Website is ready to go!</p>
