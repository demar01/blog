<h1>Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer-related preprints.</h1>
<p>It may seem evident that preprints have served as an unprecedent way of communicating scientific results during COVID-19 pandemic. I recently found a very interesting paper that investigates the attributes of COVID-19 preprints (including preprinting and publishing behaviour) and the impact of the pandemic on the scientific publishing landscape published in <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.111294v1">bioarxiv</a>.
After seeing this paper I wonder how much cancer-related preprints were affected during the pandemic ‚ùì</p>

<p>To answer that question I am going to obtained data that expands from one year before the declaration of pandemic (that‚Äôs it from 31<sup>st</sup> December 2018) up to the day I started this analysis (18<sup>th</sup> August 2020). I am also going to use some of the functions the authors use in the paper that were made publicly available on <a href="https://github.com/preprinting-a-pandemic/pandemic_preprints">github.</a></p>

<h3>Plotting the data</h3>

<p>Wow! the number of COVID-19 preprints increased tremendously along with the expansion of COVID-19 pandemic, reaching up to 2,000 preprints deposited in May (see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01394-6"><code>preprint surge</code></a>).
Early in May, preprint servers enhanced their usual screening procedures for publishing scientific articles related to COVID-19, adopting some restrictive publication norms like putting a bar on manuscripts that are solely based on computational models, and this could be one of the causes behind that drop in COVID-19 preprints after May.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of preprints were neither cancer-related nor COVID-19-related preprints.</p>
<p>The number of cancer-related preprints did not decrease when the pandemic expanded, and if anything there is a trend for more cancer-related preprints during 2019 and 2020. Despite many of the labs (including mine) being closed on the second trimester of 2020, the number of cancer-related preprints did not decreased during early days of the pandemic. Researchers could have had more time to put together results for preprint publication. I wonder though, if any category within biology research was more affected than others ü§î.</p>

<p>How many of the preprints were later published in peer-review journals after WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic on the 11 of March 2020?</p>

Almost double the number of COVID-19 preprints were published in peer-review journals upon preprint publication. This could have to do with the urgency of disseminating scientific knowledge of SAR-CoV2 virus pandemic and the little things known about SAR-CoV2 virus.</p>

<h2>Additional explorations on these data.</h2>
<p>There are some additional exploration one could do with these data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Percentage of downloads:</b> One could use the function <code>getUsageData</code> to get preprints metrics. Did scientist stopped downloading cancer-related preprints in favor of COVID-19 preprints or the number of cancer-related preprints downloads remained stable/grew during the pandemic?</p></li>
<li><p><b>Comments per preprint:</b> <a href="https://disqus.com">Disqus</a> is a comment platform that allows readers to post text comments and is featured in BioRxiv and medRxiv html pages. In the <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.111294v1.full.pdf">Fraser preprint</a> authors found that non-COVID-19 preprints were rarely commented upon, in comparison to COVID-19 preprints (Fig 5D). One could explore if the engagement level of cancer-related preprints increased upon the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic (if so, this could be because scientists that work in this research field would had have more office time to read and comment on these preprints).</p></li>
