# FANTASTIC talk on DataViz

I did not attend to [rstudioconf-2020](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/), but I engaged the #rstudioconf2020 watch many of the talks. One of them I particularly loved was **"The glamour of Graphic"** by [Will Chase](https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/the-glamour-of-graphics/). As he sayed in his talk, once you learnt certain things, you cannot stop noticing where those amazing trick are not being used, and I find this to be so true for dataviz!

I start from the premise that any plotting should be done with ggplot2. I find that starting with tidy data is the main benefit of ggplot2.

![_Three rules makes a dataset tidy: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells_](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demar01/blog/master/static/img/tidy-data.png)

In that talk, Will talked how we should build graphics using the three layers of grammar but thing about the three layers of glamour

I am going to explore cute **palmerpenguins**, and interesting alternative to the iris dataset. It has measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.

# Install package

```{r install, include=FALSE}
library(knitr)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE,
                      echo = TRUE, dpi = 300, cache.lazy = FALSE,
                      tidy = "styler", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5)
```

# Loading Library

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(skimr)
library(janitor) # this is to have clean names
```


One observation is that there are missing values, which are not present in the iris dataset. Let's count where the missing values are

```{r plot, include=TRUE}
penguins %>%
     #dplyr::select(everything()) %>%
     summarise_all(funs(sum(is.na(.)))) %>%
     pivot_longer(cols = 1:7, names_to = 'columns', values_to = 'NA_count') %>%
     mutate_if(is.character,as.factor) %>%
     mutate(columns = fct_reorder(columns, NA_count)) %>%
     ggplot(aes(y = columns, x = NA_count)) +
     geom_col(fill = 'darkorange') +
     geom_label(aes(label = NA_count)) +
     #   scale_fill_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
     theme_classic()+
     labs(title = 'Penguins - NA Count',
      subtitle = 'Aesthetic fixes', caption = "Graphic:
     @dermitmaria\nData:Penguins")+
       theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(),
       axis.title.y=element_blank(),
        plot.title.position = "plot",
        plot.caption.position =  "plot")
```

1. Things that I learnt on that course and applied on this plot:
    - Descending order
    - Left-aligned text
    - Remove labels
    

2. Things that I learnt on that course but have not applied on this plot:
    - The importance of good font.
    - Clean names
    - Remove white spaces
