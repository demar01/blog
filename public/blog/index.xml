      <description>LPDG on proteogenomics What a fantastic talk by Janne Lehtio! He gave an overview of the lattest research and resources available from his lab, including DEqMS to perform differential protein expression from qproteomics data, improved version of the limma approach, as well as the familiar papers on proteome subcellular localization and breast cancer proteome landscape beautifully summarised using shiny apps.</description>

      <description>Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer-related preprints. It may seem evident that preprints have served as an unprecedent way of communicating scientific results during COVID-19 pandemic. I recently found a very interesting paper that investigates the attributes of COVID-19 preprints (including preprinting and publishing behaviour) and the impact of the pandemic on the scientific publishing landscape published in bioarxiv. After seeing this paper I wonder how much cancer-related preprints were affected during the pandemic ‚ùì</description>

      <description>Image Classification With Convolutional Neural Networks In this article I will explore how to build a CNN using keras and classify images. My aim is to learn the basic of CNN, learn how use the tools to build them and use these tools to analyse digital pathology images.
One popular way to do image classification is buy building Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) using keras. CNN is a class of deep learning neural networks that uses a number of filters to extract features from images.</description>

      <description>Sentiment analysis on Katty Perry upcoming album Smile. Smile is the upcoming sixth studio album by American singer Katy Perry. It is scheduled to be released in two weeks time, on August 28 2020. Perry describes her last album Smile as her ‚Äújourney towards the light, with stories of resilience, hope, and love‚Äù. According to her, she has gone through some emotionally challenged times lately, and expecting a child could just add more into that emotional roller coaster üé¢.</description>

      <description>Motivation to do this exploration A fantastic paper investigating the proteins that bind directly to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in virally infected human cells has been recently published by Mathias Munschauer group. The authors used purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to get the proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 when this infects human cells in an unbiased manner.
I got super curious about these data and wanted to explore myself. I wanted to visualised the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins which certainly will contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology better.</description>

      <description>FANTASTIC talk on DataViz I did not attend to rstudioconf-2020, but I engaged the #rstudioconf2020 watch many of the talks. One of them I particularly loved was ‚ÄúThe glamour of Graphic‚Äù by Will Chase. As he sayed in his talk, once you learnt certain things, you cannot stop noticing where those amazing trick are not being used, and I find this to be so true for dataviz!
I start from the premise that any plotting should be done with ggplot2.</description>

      <description>How I set up this website The purpose of this post is to show the simple steps how I created this website using Github, Hugo, Rblogdown and Netfily.
First I create a new repo on my GitHub
 Then I downloaded Hugo, a static site generator and got familiar with the way the information is distributed across folders. I also realise how important choosing the right theme for your purpose is.</description>

      <description>My name is Maria Dermit and I am a postdoctoral research assistant at Barts Cancer Institute where I work on big data to understand the importance of post-translational regulation on cancer growth.
I studied biochemistry, finishing my PhD in 2017. During my academic research I have worked mainly with proteomics and transcriptomics and analysing published data. You can find my PhD thesis here
