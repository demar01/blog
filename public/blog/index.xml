      <description>Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on cancer-related preprints. It may seem evident that preprints have served as an unprecedent way of communicating scientific results during COVID-19 pandemic. I recently found a very interesting paper that investigates the attributes of COVID-19 preprints (including preprinting and publishing behaviour) and the impact of the pandemic on the scientific publishing landscape published in bioarxiv. After seeing this paper I wonder how much cancer-related preprints were affected during the pandemic ‚ùì</description>

      <description>Sentiment analysis on Katty Perry upcoming album Smile. Smile is the upcoming sixth studio album by American singer Katy Perry. It is scheduled to be released in two weeks time, on August 28 2020. Perry describes her last album Smile as her ‚Äújourney towards the light, with stories of resilience, hope, and love‚Äù. According to her, she has gone through some emotionally challenged times lately, and expecting a child could just add more into that emotional roller coaster üé¢.</description>

      <description>Motivation to do this exploration A fantastic paper investigating the proteins that bind directly to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in virally infected human cells has been recently published by Mathias Munschauer group. The authors used purification and mass spectrometry (RAP-MS) to get the proteome that directly binds the SARS-CoV-2 when this infects human cells in an unbiased manner.
I got super curious about these data and wanted to explore myself. I wanted to visualised the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of SARS-CoV-2 interacting proteins which certainly will contribute to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 biology better.</description>

In the paper, the authors gather phosphorylation sites from 6,801 proteomics experiments and created a reference phosphoproteome containing 119,809 human phosphosites. More importantly, the evaluated with a regression model the contribution of each phosphorylation site (funcitonal measured as a readout of anotation in PhosphoSitePlus.</description>

I find this utterly non-sense! To demonstrate my point, I analyse two artist Martin and I really like: on my case Rosalia and on Martin‚Äôs case The bouncing Souls. I took this information from his lab Spotify playlist.</description>

      <description>FANTASTIC talk on DataViz I did not attend to rstudioconf-2020, but I engaged the #rstudioconf2020 watch many of the talks. One of them I particularly loved was ‚ÄúThe glamour of Graphic‚Äù by Will Chase. As he sayed in his talk, once you learnt certain things, you cannot stop noticing where those amazing trick are not being used, and I find this to be so true for dataviz!
I start from the premise that any plotting should be done with ggplot2.</description>

      <description>UK goverment message In order to know what messages are being twitted by UK‚Äôs PM I analysed his timeline. Reporting the most recent 3,200 statuses, it is clear that the number of Brexit messages out-passes Covid-related tweets.

      <description>How I set up this website The purpose of this post is to show the simple steps how I created this website using Github, Hugo, Rblogdown and Netfily.
First I create a new repo on my GitHub
 Then I downloaded Hugo, a static site generator and got familiar with the way the information is distributed across folders. I also realise how important choosing the right theme for your purpose is.</description>
