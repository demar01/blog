# Motivation to do this comparison
Given that we are in pride month `r emo::ji("rainbow")`, I came across this   [article](Thttps://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/), where it was really great to see increase trend for homosexuality, and not so great to see low accpetance in some regions.

I decided to use this great dataset to see by myself the trends towards diversity over the past two decades.

## Steps to do these analyses
### Data Collection
I got the data from [Pew Research Centre](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/datasets/) 

```{r, echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
theme_set(theme_classic())
dataset = read.spss("/Users/dermit01/Desktop/Pew-Research-Center-Spring-2018-Global-Attitudes-Survey (1)/Pew Research Global Attitudes Spring 2018 Dataset WEB FINAL.sav", to.data.frame=TRUE)

```


### The question I want to explore is: how is diversity perceived across different countries
This is the question is located the survey dataset
```{r}
get_spss_label(dataset, 10)
names(dataset)[10]
```

### Data visualization
```{r}
dataset %>% 
  select(diversity20yr_fu,COUNTRY) %>% 
  group_by(COUNTRY,diversity20yr_fu) %>% 
  tally  %>%
  group_by(COUNTRY) %>%
  mutate(pct=(100*n)/sum(n)) %>% 
  filter(diversity20yr_fu %in% c("Good thing","Bad thing")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(pct,fct_reorder(COUNTRY,pct,.fun=max),label=paste0(round(pct, 0), "%"))) +
  geom_segment(aes( xend = pct, yend = COUNTRY)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = diversity20yr_fu),size = 5) +
  geom_text(color = "white", size = 2)+
  scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette("Royal1"))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels =function(l) {
    paste0(l,"%")}, limits=c(0,100)) +
  #geom_text(aes(label = diversity20yr_fu, size = 8, vjust =-1)) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 8, y = "Indonesia", label = "Bad thing"), 
  color = wes_palette("Royal1")[2], size = 4, family = "", vjust = 2) +
  geom_text(aes(x = 85, y = "Indonesia", label = "Good thing"),
  color = wes_palette("Royal1")[1], size = 4, family = "", vjust = 2) +
  labs(title=gsub("this","diversity",gsub("\\(survey country\\)",
  "your country",get_spss_label(dataset, 10))), y="", x="",
  subtitle = "% who say diversity is a good or a bad thing",
  caption="Source:   Pew-Research-Center-Spring-2018") +
    theme_classic()+
  theme(
      legend.position = "none",
      plot.title=element_text(size=10, family=""),  # title
      plot.title.position = "plot",
      plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic", size = 10),
      plot.caption=element_text(size=8),  # caption
      #plot.caption.position = "plot",
      axis.title.x=element_text(size=10),  # X axis title
      axis.title.y=element_text(size=10),  # Y axis title
      axis.text.x=element_text(size=10),  # X axis text
      axis.text.y=element_text(size=10),
      plot.margin = margin(2,50,5,25)) 

```

## Conlusions
It looks like there are some countries with more polarised views on Diversity such as Indonesia and South Korea, and other countries such as Hungary and Poland where diversity is  considered as neither a good or a bad thing. 

Interestingly, some countries consider diversity mostly as a bad thing(such as Greece and Nigeria).

There are several other factors analysed in the survey such as education, religion, income etc, and those factors are associated with some of the replies of this survey.
