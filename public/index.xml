      <description>FANTASTIC talk on DataViz I did not attend to rstudioconf-2020, but I engaged the #rstudioconf2020 watch many of the talks. One of them I particularly loved was ‚ÄúThe glamour of Graphic‚Äù by Will Chase. As he sayed in his talk, once you learnt certain things, you cannot stop noticing where those amazing trick are not being used, and I find this to be so true for dataviz!
I start from the premise that any plotting should be done with ggplot2.</description>

      <description>How I set up this website The purpose of this post is to show the simple steps how I created this website using Github, Hugo, Rblogdown and Netfily.
First I create a new repo on my GitHub
 Then I downloaded Hugo, a static site generator and got familiar with the way the information is distributed across folders. I also realise how important choosing the right theme for your purpose is.</description>

      <description>Making ribosomes to translate cancer I delivered a talk at BCI Thursday seminar series on our work on regulation of ribosome biogenesis by subcellular RNA localization.
In this work published in bioarxiv I demonstrated how a RBP called LARP6 regulates ribosome biogenesis in migrating cells. You could watch the full talk (QMUL access only) here</description>

      <description>My name is Maria Dermit and I am a postdoctoral research assistant at Barts Cancer Institute where I work on big data to understand the importance of post-translational regulation on cancer growth.
I studied biochemistry, finishing my PhD in 2017. During my academic research I have worked mainly with proteomics and transcriptomics and analysing published data. You can find my PhD thesis here
The aim of this blog is to write about new tricks I learn about the tidyverse.</description>
