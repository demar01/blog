# How I set up this website

The purpose of this post is to show the simple steps how I created this website using Github, Hugo, Rblogdown and Netfily. 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

1. First I create a new repo on my github 

2. Then I downloaded [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator and got familiar with the way the information is distributed across folders. Also, the importance of choosing the right theme for your purpose. In my case I wanted something simple, but for acedemia "Acedemi" is very popular and gives you load of flexibility. I found this, this and these links particularly useful.

3. Download Rblogdown package and I genually get to know a bit about about this project Yihui Xi this link

4.Use Netlify to deploy the content of the web into the public domain.
